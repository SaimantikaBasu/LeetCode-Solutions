/**
 * The challenge no.215 asks for the kth largest element of an array to be returned.
 * 
 * To solve this problem, the array has to be sorted and then the Kth element from the top will be returned.
 * 
 * To save some processing time, the array only gets sorted for K elements which is slightly faster than sorting all elements.
